#  SQL LeetCode Questions and Answers

This repo includes SQL problems with queries I’ve solved — mainly from LeetCode.  
It’s for quick reference, learning, and practice.

- Multiple solutions are given when useful (marked with `-- OR`).
- Includes joins, subqueries, CTEs, window functions, and aggregates.
- Mostly written in MySQL syntax but easy to convert for PostgreSQL.
- Simple formatting so you can copy, run, and edit fast.

##  Topics Covered
- Basic SELECT and WHERE filters  
- Aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.)
